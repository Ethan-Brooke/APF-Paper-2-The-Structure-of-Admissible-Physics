def check_L_irr():
    """L_irr: Irreversibility from Admissibility Physics.

    CLAIM: A1 + L_nc + L_loc ==> A4 (irreversibility).

    MECHANISM (Option D — locality-based irreversibility):
        Irreversibility arises because cross-interface correlations
        commit capacity that no LOCAL observer can recover. This is
        compatible with monotone E (L3) at each interface.

    PROOF (4 steps):

    Step 1 -- Superadditivity is generic [L_nc].
        L_nc gives Delta(S1,S2) > 0: joint enforcement at a shared
        interface exceeds the sum of individual costs.

    Step 2 -- Enforcement is factorized [L_loc].
        Enforcement distributes over multiple interfaces with
        independent budgets. Observer at Gamma_S has no access
        to Gamma_E. Operations are LOCAL to each interface.

    Step 3 -- Cross-interface correlations are locally unrecoverable.
        When system S interacts with environment E, the interaction
        commits capacity Delta > 0 at BOTH Gamma_S and Gamma_E
        simultaneously. Freeing this capacity requires coordinated
        action at both interfaces. No single local observer can
        perform this (L_loc forbids cross-interface operations).
        Therefore the correlation capacity is permanently committed
        from the perspective of any local observer.

    Step 4 -- Locally unrecoverable capacity = irreversibility.
        From S's perspective: capacity committed to S-E correlations
        is lost. The pre-interaction state is unrecoverable by any
        S-local operation. This is structural irreversibility:
        not probabilistic, not by fiat, but forced by A1+L_nc+L_loc.

    KEY DISTINCTION FROM OLD L_irr (v4.x):
        Old: "record-lock" -- removing distinction r from a state
        activates a conflict making the result inadmissible.
        PROBLEM: requires non-monotone E, contradicting L3.
        (Proof: if E monotone, S\\{r} subset S => E(S\\{r}) <= E(S) <= C,
        so S\\{r} is always admissible. No lock possible.)

        New: "locally unrecoverable correlations" -- all states remain
        globally admissible, but cross-interface capacity cannot be
        freed by any LOCAL operation. Monotonicity holds at each
        interface. Irreversibility comes from LIMITED ACCESS, not
        from states being unreachable in the full state space.

    EXECUTABLE WITNESS:
        3 distinctions {s, e, c} (system, environment, correlation).
        2 interfaces Gamma_S (C=15), Gamma_E (C=15).
        E is monotone and superadditive at both interfaces.
        ALL 8 subsets are globally admissible (no state is trapped).
        Cross-interface correlation c commits capacity at BOTH
        interfaces; no operation at Gamma_S alone can free it.

    COUNTERMODEL (necessity of L_nc):
        Additive world (Delta=0): correlations cost zero.
        No capacity committed to cross-interface terms.
        All capacity is locally recoverable. Fully reversible.

    COUNTERMODEL (necessity of L_loc):
        Single-interface world: observer has global access.
        All correlations are recoverable. Fully reversible.

    """L_loc: Locality from Admissibility Physics.

    CLAIM: A1 (admissibility physics) + M (multiplicity) + NT (non-triviality)
           ==> A3 (locality / enforcement decomposition over interfaces).

    PROOF (4 steps):

    Step 1 -- Single-interface capacity bound.
        A1: C < infinity. L_epsilon*: each independent distinction costs >= epsilon > 0.
        A single interface can enforce at most floor(C/epsilon) distinctions.

    Step 2 -- Richness exceeds single-interface capacity.
        M + NT: the number of independently meaningful distinctions
        N_phys exceeds any single interface's capacity: N_phys > floor(C_max/epsilon).

    Step 3 -- Distribution is forced.
        N_phys > floor(C_max/epsilon) ==> no single interface can enforce all
        distinctions. Enforcement MUST distribute over >= 2 independent loci.

    Step 4 -- Interface independence IS locality.
        Multiple interfaces with independent budgets means:
        (a) No interface has global access (each enforces a subset).
        (b) Enforcement demand decomposes over interfaces.
        (c) Subsystems at disjoint interfaces are independent.
        This IS A3 (locality).

    NO CIRCULARITY:
        L_loc uses only A1 + M + NT (not L_nc, not A3).
        Then L_nc uses A1 + A3 (= L_loc).
        Then L_irr uses A1 + L_nc.
        Each step uses only prior results.

    EXECUTABLE WITNESS (verified in L_irr_L_loc_single_axiom_reduction.py):
        6 distinctions, epsilon = 2:
        - Single interface (C=10): full set costs 19.5 > 10 (inadmissible)
        - Two interfaces (C=10 each): 8.25 each <= 10 (admissible)
        - Locality FORCED: single interface insufficient, distribution works.

    COUNTERMODEL:
        |D|=1 world: single interface (C=10) easily enforces everything.
        Confirms M (multiplicity) is necessary.

    DEFINITIONAL POSTULATES (not physics axioms):
        M (Multiplicity):     |D| >= 2. "The universe contains stuff."
        NT (Non-Triviality):  Distinctions are heterogeneous.

    STATEMENT: The enforcement cost of any structure E under A1 is
    uniquely C(E) = n(E) * epsilon. For a gauge group G, n(G) = dim(G).
    No alternative cost functional compatible with A1 exists.

    PROOF STRUCTURE (4 sub-lemmas, all [P]):

    L_cost_C1 (Ledger Completeness):
      A1's universal quantifier 'any S' means the capacity ledger is
      exhaustive. A hidden resource R would support distinctions beyond
      C(Gamma), but those distinctions are members of some S at Gamma,
      and A1 constrains ALL such S. Therefore cost = f(channel_count).
      Proof by contradiction: hidden resource either registers in |S|
      (counted) or doesn't support enforcement (not a resource).

    L_cost_C2 (Additive Independence):
      T_M proves independence <-> disjoint anchor sets (biconditional).
      L_loc gives factorization at disjoint interfaces. Independent
      budgets preclude synergy/interference. Therefore:
        f(n1 + n2) = f(n1) + f(n2).

    L_cost_GP (Generator Primitivity):
      PROOF A (Topological, primary):
        T3: gauge group = Aut(M_n), a d-dimensional manifold.
        Orbit-separation lemma: enforcing G-equivariance requires

      PROOF B (Non-closure, confirmatory):
        Bracket [T_a, T_b] is composition (4 exponentials). L_nc:
        composition is non-free (interaction cost I >= 0, generically
        positive). Each bracket-generated direction costs >= epsilon
        (L_epsilon*). After closure: all dim(G) directions populated,
        each costing >= epsilon. Total >= dim(G)*epsilon.

      Both proofs: n(G) = dim(G), no reduction possible.

def check_L_irr_uniform():
    """L_irr_uniform: Sector-Uniform Irreversibility.

    STATEMENT: If irreversibility occurs in the gravitational sector,
    then any non-trivially coupled gauge-matter sector must also
    contain irreversible channels at the interfaces where gravitational
    records are committed.

    SOURCE: Paper 7 v8.5, Section 6.4 (Lemma Lirr-uniform).

    PROOF (3 steps):

    Step 1 (Irreversibility is interface-local):
      By L_loc, enforcement is distributed over finite interfaces; there
      is no global observer. Irreversibility arises because cross-interface
      correlations (Delta>0) commit capacity that no local observer can
      recover. At gravitational interfaces, these correlations create
      a locally unrecoverable capacity commitment.

    Step 2 (Coupling implies shared record dependence):
      The metric arises from non-factorization of enforcement cost at
      shared interfaces (T7B). Therefore gauge and gravitational
      enforcement share interfaces by construction: gauge distinctions G
      contribute to the cross-terms that define the metric. Consequently,
      there exist admissible histories H, H' that differ by gauge-side
      distinctions and yield different gravitational records:
      R_Gamma(H) != R_Gamma(H'). If no such histories existed, gauge
      distinctions would have no recordable consequences and the gauge
      sector would be observationally trivial.

    Step 3 (Non-closure forces irreversibility at shared interfaces):
      Since G and R_Gamma coexist at Gamma, L_nc implies superadditivity:
      E_Gamma(G union R_Gamma) > E_Gamma(G) + E_Gamma(R_Gamma)
      generically. With finite C_Gamma (A1), undoing R_Gamma while G
      persists costs more than undoing R_Gamma alone -- the superadditive
      excess can exceed the remaining capacity budget, making reversal
      inadmissible. Hence an irreversible channel exists at a
      gauge-coupled interface.

    CONSEQUENCE: L_irr applies to gauge-matter sector without additional
    assumptions. Any sector participating in record-differentiable histories
    inherits irreversibility at shared interfaces. This is needed for the
    chirality argument (R2): Lirr must hold in the gauge sector, not only
    in gravity.

    """M_Omega: Microcanonical Horizon Measure.

    STATEMENT: Let Gamma be a fully saturated interface with admissible
    microstate set Omega_Gamma(M) compatible with macroscopic constraints M.
    Then the induced probability measure over Omega_Gamma(M) is uniform
    (microcanonical).

    STATUS: [P] -- CLOSED.

    PROOF (4 steps):

    Step 1 (Non-uniformity is an additional distinction):
      Suppose p(s) is not uniform over Omega_Gamma(M). Then there exist
      microstates s1, s2 sharing the same macroscopic data M with
      p(s1) != p(s2). This inequality is a distinction: the interface
      treats s1 and s2 differently despite identical macroscopic labels.

    Step 2 (Distinctions require enforcement, from A1 + L_epsilon*):
      Any physically meaningful distinction must be supported by
      enforcement capacity: some record or constraint at Gamma must
      encode the information differentiating s1 from s2. If the
      interface commits no enforcement to this difference, then under
      admissibility-preserving refinements the labeling is arbitrary
      and the bias is not refinement-invariant -- hence not meaningful.

    Step 3 (Saturation forbids extra bias-supporting records):
      Under full saturation, Gamma has no uncommitted capacity to
      support additional independent distinctions beyond those already
      fixed by M. Any biasing information (prefer s1 over s2) requires
      enforcement capacity that does not exist.

    Step 4 (Uniformity is the unique survivor):
      The only assignment p(s) that introduces no extra distinctions
      and is invariant under admissibility-preserving refinements of
      microstate labeling is constant on equivalence classes defined
      by enforceable records. In the microcanonical regime (M fixes
      no further microstate-resolving distinctions), there is one
      equivalence class: p(s) = 1/|Omega_Gamma(M)| for all s.

    CAVEAT: In partially saturated regimes, biasing microstates may be
    admissible because additional distinctions can still be enforced.
    The theorem applies at full saturation (the cosmological horizon regime).

    KEY DISTINCTION FROM L_equip:
      M_Omega proves the MEASURE is forced (uniformity).
      L_equip uses M_Omega to derive the PARTITION fractions.
      M_Omega is the foundational step; L_equip is the application.

def check_P_exhaust():
    """P_exhaust: Predicate Exhaustion (MECE Partition of Capacity).

    STATEMENT: At a fully saturated interface, exactly two independent
    mechanism predicates survive: Q1 (gauge addressability) and Q2
    (confinement). No third independent mechanism predicate exists.
    The resulting partition 3 + 16 + 42 = 61 is MECE.

    STATUS: [P] -- CLOSED.

    PROOF (by sector-by-sector exhaustion):

    MECHANISM vs QUANTUM-NUMBER PREDICATES:
      A mechanism predicate classifies capacity units by their enforcement
      PATHWAY -- how the capacity is committed (e.g., through gauge channels
      or geometric constraints). A quantum-number predicate classifies by
      the specific VALUE a label takes within a given pathway (e.g., which
      hypercharge, which generation).

      Under the microcanonical measure (M_Omega), the ensemble averages
      uniformly over microstates within each macroscopic class.
      Quantum-number values are microstate-level distinctions: the ensemble
      treats all values within a mechanism class equally. Only mechanism
      predicates survive as partition-generating criteria at the horizon.

    Q1: GAUGE ADDRESSABILITY (from T3):
      Does the capacity unit route through gauge channels
      (SU(3)*SU(2)*U(1)), or does it enforce geometric constraints
      without gauge routing?
      Yes -> matter (19). No -> vacuum (42).

    Q2: CONFINEMENT (from SU(3) structure, within Q1=1):
      Does the gauge-addressable unit carry conserved labels protected
      by SU(3) confinement? Confinement is a nonperturbative,
      scale-independent mechanism property.
      Yes -> baryonic (3). No -> dark (16).

    EXHAUSTION (no third predicate):
      (a) Vacuum sector (Q1=0, 42 units): defined by ABSENCE of
          addressable labels. Any mechanism predicate splitting this
          sector would introduce an addressable distinction among units
          classified precisely by having none -- a contradiction.
      (b) Dark sector (Q1=1, Q2=0, 16 units): gauge-singlet enforcement.
          'Singlet' means no gauge-mechanism-level label distinguishes
          these units. Splitting requires an enforcement pathway not
          present in the derived gauge group.
      (c) Baryonic sector (Q1=1, Q2=1, 3 units): indexed by N_c = 3,
          the minimal confining carrier. Already the finest
          mechanism-level resolution; no sub-ternary mechanism distinction
          exists without violating minimality of the confining carrier (R1).
      (d) Cross-cutting predicates: chirality is gauge-sector only
          (SU(2)_L). Generation index is a quantum-number value, not a
          mechanism. Hypercharge is a quantum-number value. The
          electroweak/strong distinction is already captured by Q2.

    via Doplicher-Roberts on field algebra.
    
    DR APPLICABILITY NOTE (red team v4 canonical):
      Doplicher-Roberts (1989) is formulated within the Haag-Kastler
      algebraic QFT framework, which classically assumes PoincarÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©
      covariance. However, the DR reconstruction theorem's core mechanism
      ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â recovering a compact group from its symmetric tensor category of
      representations ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â is purely algebraic (Tannaka-Krein duality).
      
      What DR actually needs from the ambient framework:
        (a) A net of algebras indexed by a POSET: provided by L_loc + L_irr
            (Delta_ordering gives a causal partial order on enforcement regions).
        (b) Isotony (inclusion-preserving): provided by L_loc (locality).
        (c) Superselection sectors with finite statistics: provided by L_irr
            (irreversibility creates inequivalent sectors) + A1 (finiteness).
      
      What DR does NOT need for the structural consequence we use:
        (d) PoincarÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© covariance: this determines HOW the gauge field transforms
            under spacetime symmetries, not WHETHER a gauge group exists.
            The existence of a compact gauge group follows from (a)-(c) alone.
      
      Therefore T3's use of DR is legitimate in the pre-geometric setting.
      The causal poset from L_irr serves as the index set; full PoincarÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©
      structure (T8, T9_grav) is needed only for the DYNAMICS of gauge
      fields, not for the EXISTENCE of gauge structure.

        (3) O1's enforcement actions draw only from anc(O1) budgets.
            O2's enforcement actions draw only from anc(O2) budgets.
            Since these budget pools are disjoint, neither can affect 
            the other. Therefore O1 and O2 are independent.  QED
    
    Proof (=>, independent -> disjoint):
        (4) Suppose anc(O1) cap anc(O2) != empty. Let i in anc(O1) cap anc(O2).
        (5) By A1: interface i has admissibility physics C_i.
        (6) O1 requires >= epsilon of C_i (from L_epsilon*: meaningful enforcement 
            costs >= eps > 0). O_2 requires >= of C_i.
        (7) Total demand at i: >= 2*epsilon. But C_i is finite.
        (8) If O1 increases its demand at i, O2's available capacity 
            at i decreases (budget competition). This is a detectable 
            correlation between O1 and O2: changing O1's state affects 
            O_2's available resources.
        (9) Detectable correlation = not independent (by definition of 
            independence: O1's state doesn't affect O2's state).
            Therefore O1 and O2 are NOT independent.  QED
    
    Corollary (monogamy degree bound):
        At interface i with capacity C_i, the maximum number of 
        independent obligations that can anchor at i is:
            n_max(i) = floor(C_i / epsilon)
        If C_i = epsilon (minimum viable interface), then n_max = 1:
        exactly one independent obligation per anchor. This is the 
        "monogamy" condition.
    
    Note: The bipartite matching structure (obligations anchors with 
    degree-1 constraint at saturation) is the origin of gauge-matter 
    duality in the particle sector.

    Theorem: eta <= epsilon, where eta is the cross-generation interference

                     distinctions d1 and d2 at different interfaces.
        epsilon = minimum cost of maintaining any single distinction (from L_eps*).
    
    Proof:
        (1) Any correlation between d1 and d2 requires both to exist
            as enforceable distinctions. (Definitional.)
        
        (2) T_M (monogamy): each distinction d participates in at most one
            independent correlation.
        
        (3) The correlation draws from d1's capacity budget.
            By A1: d1's total enforcement budget <= C_i at its anchor.
            d1 must allocate >= epsilon to its own existence.
            d1 must allocate >= eta to the correlation with d2.
            Therefore: epsilon + eta <= C_i.
        
        (4) By T_kappa: C_i >= 2*epsilon (minimum capacity per distinction).
            At saturation (C_i = 2*epsilon exactly):

        (5) For C_i > 2*epsilon, the bound is looser (eta <= C_i - epsilon),
            but the framework-wide bound is set by the TIGHTEST constraint.
            Since saturation is achievable, eta <= epsilon globally.
        
        (6) Tightness: at saturation (C_i = 2*epsilon), eta = epsilon exactly.

def check_T_kappa():
    """T_kappa: Directed Enforcement Multiplier.
    
    FULL PROOF (upgraded from sketch):
    
    Theorem: kappa = 2 is the unique enforcement multiplier consistent 
    with L_irr (irreversibility) + L_nc (non-closure).
    
    Proof of >= 2 (lower bound):
        (1) L_nc requires FORWARD enforcement: without active stabilization,
            distinctions collapse (non-closure = the environment's default 
            tendency is to merge/erase). This costs >= epsilon per distinction (T_epsilon).
            Call this commitment C_fwd at the system interface Gamma_S.
        
        (2) L_irr requires an ENVIRONMENT RECORD: when the system creates
            a distinction, the S-E correlation (Delta > 0) commits capacity
            at the environment interface Gamma_E. This environmental record
            is the "backward verification" -- it is physically the 
            environment's independent copy of the distinction's existence.
            This costs >= epsilon at Gamma_E (L_epsilon*). Call this C_env.
        
        (3) C_fwd and C_env are INDEPENDENT commitments at DIFFERENT interfaces:
            C_fwd lives at Gamma_S (system's enforcement budget).
            C_env lives at Gamma_E (environment's enforcement budget).
            By L_loc, these are independent budgets. Removing C_fwd at Gamma_S
            does not affect C_env at Gamma_E (and vice versa).
            If C_env could be derived from C_fwd, they would share an 
            interface -- contradicting L_loc's independence.
        
        (4) Total per-distinction cost >= C_fwd + C_env >= 2*epsilon.
            So kappa >= 2.
    
    Proof of <= 2 (upper bound, minimality):
        (5) A1 (admissibility physics) + principle of sufficient enforcement:
            the system allocates exactly the minimum needed to satisfy
            both L_irr and L_nc. Two interface-commitments suffice:
            one at Gamma_S (stability), one at Gamma_E (environmental record).
        
        (6) A third commitment would require a THIRD independent interface.
            But a single distinction's enforcement footprint spans at most
            two interfaces: the system where it is maintained and the 
            environment where its creation is recorded. A third interface
            would require a second environment -- but that is a new 
            correlation (a new distinction), not a third obligation on 
            the original one. Two interfaces -> two commitments -> <= 2.
        
        (7) Combining: >= 2 (steps 1-4) and <= 2 (steps 5-6) -> = 2.  QED
    
    Physical interpretation: kappa=2 is the directed-enforcement version of 
    the Nyquist theorem -- you need two independent samples (system and 
    environment) to fully characterize a distinction's enforcement state.
    The environment IS the independent auditor.
